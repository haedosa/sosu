We are a group of individuals who come from diverse backgrounds, including
science, engineering, and programming, but share a common interest in
Mathematics. Although we may not all be professional mathematicians, we use
Mathematics in our day-to-day lives and understand the importance of clarity and
precision that it brings.

As a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds with a shared interest in
Mathematics, we have selected Analysis as our first subject, and we have chosen
to follow [Tao's Analysis
book](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Third-Texts-Readings-Mathematics/dp/9380250649)
as our primary resource. We strongly believe that problem-solving is the most
effective way to learn Mathematics and have thus adopted a problem-solving
approach that incorporates [structured
derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_derivations) notation when
writing proofs.

Structured derivation notation is a powerful tool that allows us to present our
proofs in a clear and logical manner. By utilizing this notation, we can ensure
that our ideas are conveyed accurately and efficiently, thus enhancing our
ability to communicate effectively in various fields that require accuracy and
precision.

We recognize that the study of Mathematics requires dedication and perseverance,
but we believe that the insights we gain will be valuable not only in our
personal lives but also in our professional pursuits. As we continue to study
Analysis together, we look forward to supporting each other in our learning and
to sharing our insights with others.
