#+title: Axiom 3.9

- *Axiom 3.9.* (Regularity). /If $A$ is a non-empty set, then there is at least one element $x$ of $A$ which is either not a set, or is disjoint from $A$./


- Excerpt from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_regularity][wiki]]: In first order logic, (ignoring urelement), it can be written as $\forall A (A \neq \emptyset \implies \exists x ( x \in A \land x \cap A = \emptyset))$
