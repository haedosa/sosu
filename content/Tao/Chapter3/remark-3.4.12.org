#+title: Remark 3.4.12

*Remark 3.4.12* The axioms of set theory that we have introduced ([[../Chapter3.org][Axiom 3.1-3.11]], excluding the dangerous [[./axiom-3.8.org][Axiom 3.8]]) are known as the /Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of the theory/, after Ernest Zermelo (1871-1953) and Abraham Fraenkel (1891-1965).
There is one further axiom we will eventually need, the famous /axiom of choice/ (see Section 8.4), giving rise to the /Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) axioms of set theory,/ but we will not need this axiom for some time.
