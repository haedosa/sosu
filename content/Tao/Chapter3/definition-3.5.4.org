#+title: Definition 3.5.4

*Definition 3.5.4* (Cartesian product). If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, then we define
 /Cartesian product/ $X\times Y$ to the collection of ordered pairs,
 whose first component lies in $X$ and second component lies in $Y$, thus
 $$
 X\times Y=\{(x,y):x\in X,y\in Y\}
 $$
 or equivalently
 $$
 a\in(X\times Y)\iff(a=(x,y) \text{ for some } x\in X\text{ and }y\in Y).
 $$
