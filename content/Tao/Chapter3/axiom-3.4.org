#+title: Axiom 3.4

*Axiom 3.4.* (Singleton sets and pair sets). /If $a$ is an object, then there exists a set $\{a\}$ whose only element is $a$, i.e., for every object $y$, we have $y\in\{a\}$ if and only if $y=a$; we refer to $\{a\}$ as the singleton set whose element is $a$. Furthermore, if $a$ and $b$ are objects, then there exists a set $\{a,b\}$ whose only elements are $a$ and $b$; i.e., for every object $y$, we have $y\in\{a,b\}$ if and only if $y=a$ or $y=b$; we refer to this set as the *pair set* formed by $a$ and $b$./
