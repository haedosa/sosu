#+title: Definition 3.4.1

*Definition 3.4.1* (Images of sets). If $f:X\to Y$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$, and $S$ is a set in $X$, we define $f(S)$ to be the set
$$
f(S):=\{f(x):x\in S\}
$$
this set is a subset of $Y$, and is sometimes called the /image/ of $S$ under the map $f$.
We sometimes call $f(S)$ the /forward image/ of $S$ to distinguish it from the concept of the /inverse image/ $f^{-1}(S)$ of $S$, which is defined below.


Note that the set $f(S)$ is well-defined thanks to the axiom of replacement ([[./axiom-3.6.org][Axiom 3.6]]).
One can also define $f(S)$ using the axiom of specification ([[./axiom-3.5.org][Axiom 3.5]]) instead of replacement, but we leave this as a challenge to the reader.
