#+title: Axiom 3.6

*Axiom 3.6.* (Axiom of specification). /Let $A$ be a set, and for each $x\in A$, let $P(x)$ be a property pertaining to $x$ (i.e., $P(x)$ is either $a$ true statement or a false statement). Then there exists a set, called $\{x\in A:~P(x)\text{ is true}\}$ (or simply $\{x\in A:~P(x)\})$ for short), whose elements are precisely the elements $x$ in $A$ for which $P(x)$ is true. In other words, for any object $y$,/
  $$
  y\in\{x\in A:~P(x)\text{ is true}\}\iff (y\in A \text{ and } P(y)\text{ is true }).
  $$
