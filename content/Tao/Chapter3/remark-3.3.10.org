#+title: Remark 3.3.10

*Remark 3.3.10*.[fn:E: This remark is from printed version] It is not immediately apparent that [[./definition-3.3.7.org][Definition 3.3.7]] is compatible with the axioms of eqaulity in Addendix A.7, although Exercise 3.3.1 below provides evidence towards this compatibility.
There are at least three ways to address this issue.
One is to regard [[./definition-3.3.7.org][Definition 3.3.7]] as an /axiom/ about equality of functions rather than a definition.
Another is to provide a more explicit definition of a function in which [[./definition-3.3.7.org][Definition 3.3.7]] becomes a theorem;
for instance, one can define a function $f:X\to Y$ to be an ordered triple $(X,Y.Z)$ consisting of a domain set $X$,
a range set $Y$, and a graph $G=\{(x,f(x)):x\in X\}$ that obeys the vertical line test,
and use this latter graph to define the value of $f(x)\in Y$ for each element $x$ of the domain (cf. Exerciese 3.5.10).
A third way is to start with a mathematical universe $\mathcal{U}$ without any funtions in it, and use [[./definition-3.3.7.org][Definition 3.3.7]] to create a larger extension of this universe
that contains function objects that behave as specified as in [[./definition-3.3.7.org][Definition 3.3.7]].
This final procedure however requires a bit more of the formalism of logic and model theory
than is provided by this text, and so will not be detailed here.
