#+title: Axiom 3.8

- *Axiom 3.8.* (Univeral specification). /(Dangerous!) Suppose for every object $x$ we have a property $P(x)$ pertaining to $x$ (so that every $x, P(x)$ is either a true statment or a false statement). Then there exists a set $\{x:P(x)\text{ is true}\}$ such that for every object $y$,/
  $$
  y\in\{x:P(x)\text{ is true}\}\iff P(y)\text{ is true}.
  $$
\\
  This axiom is also known as the *axiom of comprehension*. It asserts that every property corresponds to a set;
  if we assumed that axiom, we could talk about the set of all blue objects, the set of all natural numbers, the set of all sets, and so forth.\\

 $$
 \Omega:=\{x:x\text{ is a set and }x\notin x\}
 $$
 $$
 \Omega\in\Omega?
