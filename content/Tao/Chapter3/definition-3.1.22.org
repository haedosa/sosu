#+title: Definition 3.1.22

*Definition 3.1.22* (Intersections). The /intersection/ $S_1\cap S_2$ of two sets is defined to be the set
  $$
  S_1\cap S_2:=\{s\in S_1:x\in S_2\}.
  $$
  In other words, $S_1\cap S_2$ consists of all the elements which belong to both $S_1$ and $S_2$. Thus, for all objects $x$,
  $$
  x\in S_1\cap S_2\iff x\in S_1\text{ and }x\in S_2.
  $$
