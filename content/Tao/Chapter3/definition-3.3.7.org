#+title: Definition 3.3.7

*Definition 3.3.7* (Equality of functions). Two functions $f:X\to Y,~g:X\to Y$ with the same domain and range are said to be *equal*,
$f=g$ if and only if $f(x)=g(x)$ for /all/ $x\in X$. (If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ agree for some values of $x$, but not others, then we do not consider
$f$ and $g$ to be equal[fn:E: In Chapter 11.45, we shall introduce a weaker notion of equality, that of two functions being equal almost everywhere].)
