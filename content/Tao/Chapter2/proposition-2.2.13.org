#+title: Proposition 2.2.13

*Proposition 2.2.13* (Trichotomy of order for natural numbers). /Let $a$ and $b$ be natural numbers. Then excactly one of the following statements is true: $a<b, a=b$, or $a>b$./

$Proof~by~Tao$ This is only sketch of the proof; the gaps will be filled in  [[./Exercise/exercise-2.2.4.org][Exercise-2.2.4]].\\
$~~$ First, we show that we cannot have more than one of the statments $a<b,~a=b,~ a>b$ holding at the same time. If $a<b$ then $a\neq b$ by [[./definition-2.2.11.org][definition]], and if $a>b$ then $a\neq b$ by [[./definition-2.2.11.org][definition]]. If $a>b$ and $a<b$ then by [[./proposition-2.2.12.org][Proposition 2.2.12]] we have $a=b$, a contradiction. Thus no more than one of the statements is true.
$~~$ Now we show that at least one of the statements is true. We keep $b$ fixed and induct on $a$. When $a=0$ we have $0\leq b$ for all $b$ ([[./Exercise/exercise-2.2.4.org][why?]]), so we have either $0=b$ or $0<b$, which proves the base case. Now suppose we have proven the proposition for $a$, and now we prove the proposition for $a\pp$. Form the trichotomy for $a$, there are three cases: $a<b,~a=b$, and $a>b$. If $a>b$, then $a\pp>b$ ([[./Exercise/exercise-2.2.4.org][why?]]). If $a=b$, then $a\pp>b$ ([[./Exercise/exercise-2.2.4.org][why?]]). Now suppose that $a<b$. Then by [[./proposition-2.2.12.org][Proposition 2.2.12]], we have $a\pp\leq b$. Thus either $a\pp=b$ or $a\pp<b$, and in either case we are done. This closes the induction. $\square$
