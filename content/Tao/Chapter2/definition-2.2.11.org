#+title: Definition 2.2.11

**Definition 2.2.11** (Ordering of the natural numbers). Let $n$ and $m$ be natural numbers. We say that $n$ is /greater than or equal to/ $m$, and write $n\geq m$ or $m\leq n$, iff we have $n=m+a$ for some natural number $a$. We say that $n$ is /strictly greater than/ $m$, and write $n>m$ or $m<n$, iff $n\geq m$ and $n\neq m$.
