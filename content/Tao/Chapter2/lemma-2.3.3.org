#+title: Lemma 2.3.3


*Lemma 2.2.3* (Positive natural numbers have no zero divisors). Let
$n, m$ be natural numbers. Then $n \times m = 0$ if and only if at least one of
$n, m$ is equal to zero. In particular, if $n$ and $m$ are both positive, then
$nm$ is also positive.

/Proof/. See [[./Exercises/exercise-2.3.2.org][Exercise 2.3.2]].
