*** A.1.1

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the negation of the statement "either X is true, or Y is true, but not both"?
\end{itemize}

either X is true or Y is true: $X \lor Y$

not both: $\lnot(X \land Y)$

either X is true or Y is true, "but" not both

$$
(X \lor Y) \land\lnot(X\land Y)
$$

Negation

$$
\begin{align}
\lnot((X \lor Y) \land\lnot(X\land Y))&=\lnot(X \lor Y) \lor \lnot(\lnot(X\land Y))\\
&=(\lnot X\land\lnot Y)\lor (X\land Y)
\end{align}
$$

Neither X is true nor Y is true or both are true

*** A.1.2
What is the negation of the statement "X is true if and only if Y is true"? (There may be multiple ways to phrase this negation).

$$
X\implies Y=\lnot(X\land\lnot Y)
$$

$$
X \iff Y = (X\implies Y)\land(Y\implies X)=\lnot(X\land\lnot Y)\land\lnot(Y\land\lnot X)
$$

$$
\lnot(\lnot(X\land\lnot Y)\land\lnot(Y\land\lnot X))=(X\land\lnot Y)\lor(Y\land\lnot X)
$$

Either X is true and Y is false, or X is false and Y is true.

*** A.1.3
Suppose that you have shown that whenever X is true, the Y is true, and whenever Y is false, then X is false. Have you now demonstrated that X is true if and only if Y is true? Explain.

$$
X\iff Y = (X\implies Y)\land(Y\implies X)
$$

$\lnot X\implies\lnot Y$ is contraposition of $Y\implies X$. Hence,

$$
(X\implies Y)\land((\lnot X\implies\lnot Y)=(X\implies Y)\land(Y\implies X)=X\iff Y
$$

It demonstrates that X is true if and only if Y is true.

Suppose that you have shown that whenever X is true, then Y is true, and whenever Y is false, then X is false. Have you now demonstrated that X is true if and only if Y is true? Explain.

$$
X\iff Y = (X\implies Y)\land(Y\implies X)
$$

$\lnot Y\implies\lnot X$ is contraposition of $X\implies Y$. Hence,

$$
(X\implies Y)\land((\lnot Y\implies\lnot X)=(X\implies Y)\land(X\implies Y)=X\implies Y
$$

It does not demonstrate that X is true if and only if Y is true.

*** A.1.5
Suppose you know that X is true if and only if Y true, and you know that Y is true if and only if Z is true. Is this enough to show that X, Y, Z are all logically quivalent? Explain.


|$A$|$B$|$A\iff B$|
|T  |T  |T        |
|T  |F  |F        |
|F  |T  |F        |
|F  |F  |T        |


X iff Y states that X and Y are logically equivalent, and Y iff Z states that Y and Z are logically equivalent. Therefore, X iff Y and Y iff Z state that X, Y, Z are logically equivalent.

*** A.1.6
Soppose you know that whenever X is true, then Y is true; that whenever Y is true, then Z is true; and whenever Z is true, then X is true. Is this enough to show that X, Y, Z are all logically equivalent? Explain.

$(X\implies Y)\land(Y\implies Z)\land(Z\implies X)$ states that X, Y, Z are logically equivalent.
