In [[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/21016/21016-pdf.pdf][Dedekind's essay]], he says that it is easy to show that there exists
infinitely many cuts not produced by rational numbers. As a typeical example, he
lets $D$ a positive integer but not the square of in integer and defines a cut
using $D$ as
\begin{equation}
(A_1, A_2) \,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
A_1 &= \{ q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid q \notin A_2 \} \\
A_2 &= \{ q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid| q^2 > D, q > 0 \} \,.
\end{align}

He says that this cut $(A_1, A_2)$ is not produced by a rational number and shows us a proof.
We shall reproduce his proof here using the structured derivation syntax.

\vspace{1em}

 \bullet The cut $(A_1, A_2)$ is not produced by a rational number
-  If a rational number $q$ produces a cut $(L, H)$, then $q$ is either the greatest of $L$ or the least of $H$

\begin{align*}
 & \bullet \text{ The cut $(A_1, A_2)$ is not produced by a rational number} \\
 & -  \text { If a rational number $q$ produces a cut $(L, H)$, then $q$ is either the greatest of $L$ or the least of $H$}
\end{align*}
